# Topics in ITP: Contributing to ml5.js (Research)

This course is a studio-oriented seminar where students will actively participate in the evolution of the ml5.js open source project. The structure of this course is inspired by initiatives such as the Processing Foundation Fellowship and Google Summer of Code.

This is a research course, which is different structures compared to normal courses. The class offers a structure and resources for your own research, as opposed to a more typical curriculum.

## Statement of Academic Integrity

Plagiarism is presenting someone else’s work as though it were your own. More specifically, plagiarism is to present as your own: A sequence of words quoted without quotation marks from another writer or a paraphrased passage from another writer’s work or facts, ideas or images composed by someone else.

## Statement of Principle

The core of the educational experience at the Tisch School of the Arts is the creation of original academic and artistic work by students for the critical review of faculty members. It is therefore of the utmost importance that students at all times provide their instructors with an accurate sense of their current abilities and knowledge in order to receive appropriate constructive criticism and advice. Any attempt to evade that essential, transparent transaction between instructor and student through plagiarism or cheating is educationally self-defeating and a grave violation of Tisch School of the Arts community standards.
