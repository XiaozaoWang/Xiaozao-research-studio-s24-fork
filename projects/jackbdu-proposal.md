# Machine Learning Tutorials for Absolute Beginners

## Abstract

This project aims to create educational materials tailored for beginners in machine learning, with a specific emphasis on fostering hands-on learning through exploratory and experimental projects utilizing ml5.js. By providing clear guidance and resources, the project seeks to demystify machine learning concepts and empower learners to engage actively in creative and artistic applications of the ml5.js library.

## Objectives

The objectives of this project are to assist beginners in getting started with ml5.js and to inspire and encourage them to explore and experiment with its capabilities. By doing so, the project aims to help ml5.js reach a broad audience and to foster a culture of creativity and experimentation within the broader creative coding community.

## Methodology

This project adopts an iterative approach, with a primary focus on tutorial creation within the designated timeframe. To achieve this, I will utilize various methods, including hands-on experimentation with ml5.js, extensive research on machine learning concepts, and collaboration with educators and learners to ensure content accessibility and relevance. Additionally, I plan to engage with the community through creative workshops, social media platforms, and educational events to solicit feedback and foster collaboration. User testing will involve gathering feedback from both educators and learners through surveys and usability testing sessions to iteratively improve the materials.

## Final Deliverable

The final deliverable will consist of written tutorials complemented by sample projects. These written tutorials will provide comprehensive guidance for beginners to get started with ml5.js, covering key concepts, practical applications, and step-by-step instructions for implementing machine learning projects.

## Timeline

- Nov 1 - Nov 3: Conduct preliminary research and submit initial project proposal.
- Nov 3 - Jan 31: Experiment with ml5.js in creative projects.
- Jan 31 - Feb 14: Continue to familiarize with ml5.js, gather resources.
- Feb 14 - Feb 28: Finalize project plan, create and conduct a [ml5.js workshop](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AojKtnWTGps3-5n5kPCmIKftJGmS7kUp_P9bjMNapmA/edit?usp=sharing).
- Feb 28 - Mar 13: Create tutorials for faceMesh, handPose, and sentiment
- Mar 13 - Mar 27: Create tutorials for bodyPose, and bodySegmentation
- Mar 27 - Apr 10: Create tutorials for neuralNetwork and neuroEvolution
- Apr 10 - Apr 17: Prepare final presentation.

## Challenges

- Gathering feedback
    - One challenge lies in garnering adequate feedback within the proposed timeline from both teachers and students to ensure iterative improvements. Achieving this may require support in devising proactive outreach and engagement strategies.
- Timeframe
    - The project operates within a constrained timeframe. Prioritizing written tutorials over video tutorials reduces production time while ensuring ease of sharing and editing. Insights into tutorial video production workflows would greatly aid in managing this process more efficiently.
