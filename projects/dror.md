# Title

## Abstract

Context ml5 is an AI-driven learning environment designed to teach ml5 to artists, designers, and creatives. It has three main components. First, using a semantic retrieval network with a large database as a context for content generation. Second, dynamically update the database from the live ml5 library. These two components can have a great impact on the ml5 community, as they can allow for a swift creation of learning material that is both accurate and up-to-date. In the rapidly changing landscape of AI, this will allow learners to always be informed with the most updated information. 

The third and last component I want to experiment with is the use of AI to learn from user engagement how to improve learning satisfaction. This experimentation will require multiple models that will work together to ensure a positive learning experience. One model will create learning materials, and the other will measure the success and satisfaction of the learner, to feed back into the learning generator. Experimentation with these three components will help create a positive learning experience for any person who wants to use AI on the web. If the experiments are successful, they will not only help the ml5 community, but the creative coding community at large.

## Objectives

1. Create a learning platform that takes a large data set and creates learning experiences based on that using a semantic retriever network.
2. Make the retrieved information respond live to the changes in the library. 
3. Create a system that uses the learner’s input and interactions to refine the learning experience and improve satisfaction.

These objectives will help people in the ml5 community to learn to use the platform in three main ways. First, it will ensure that each learner gets the learning experience they need to reach the goals they set for themselves. Second, it will ensure the accuracy of the information even when the library changes and adapts. Third, it will ensure higher satisfaction by learning about how each learner prefers to engage with the platform.

There are two main gaps that I’m trying to bridge. One is that the off-the-shelf OpenAI API doesn’t hallucinate at times and is not updated on the newest information on the internet. By creating a dynamic data-based knowledge retrieval system, I hope to address this. Second, is that many learning experiences are not adaptive to learners’ satisfaction, ensuring a better experience as they learn. If I can teach AI to create a more satisfying learning experience, I can improve ml5 community members' and other learners’ experiences. 

## Methodology

I’m planning to experiment with Google’s and OpenAI’s retrieval networks and create a systematic way to scrape the ml5 dynamically as it updates. Additionally, I plan to generate learning experiences and make learners rank them in order to feed them into an AI model and try to improve the experience. In both experiments, I will test the experience of users and measure their satisfaction with surveys. 

## Challenges

I believe that increasing learners’ satisfaction using AI is not a straightforward task. I might need to find creative ways to address that with little to no data to work with.

## Final Deliverable

My final deliverables will be a website and the survey results evaluating learners' satisfaction.
